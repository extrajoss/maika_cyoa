Here is your awesome Choose Your Own Adventure project with a little Dad mucking about with the code even though he doesn't know what he is doing in Python.

## How to run
If you don't want to mess about with git you can just download the zip, extract the files, and then from the command line, in the project folder you have extracted the files into, run it with:

`python3 main.py`
